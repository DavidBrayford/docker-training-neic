# Singularity @ HPC Workshop on Containers and Unikernels, On-line PRACE Event, July 5th-9th 2021

Welcome to the hands-on repository of **Singulary** at the **HPC Workshop on Containers and Unikernels** organized by **PRACE**.

In this repository are available some basic exercise to practice with Singularity, organized in sub-directories. 

In each sub-directory you can find the recipe, the source codes and the slurm job script template for the exercise proposed during the lesson.
